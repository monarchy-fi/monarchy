# Security

Monarchy is a testnet build for the Ascend x Elysium Builder Competition. It has had four internal security reviews but no third-party audit yet. Don't use it with real funds yet.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately through GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/monarchy-fi/monarchy/security/advisories/new) rather than in a public issue. Include the contract, the steps to reproduce and the impact you expect. We'll acknowledge the report and keep you updated while we fix it.

## Scope

- `contracts/src`: Lodestar, LodestarFactory, AscendSwapper, Exile, Sandfall and their libraries
- The deployment scripts in `contracts/script`

Mocks under `contracts/src/mocks` and the website are out of scope for security reports, though bug reports are welcome as issues.

## Reviews

Four internal security reviews have run. Each finding was shown with a proof-of-concept test or a concrete code path. None of them is a third-party audit, which comes before mainnet.

- **October 17, 2026:** a first pass over all five contracts, then two deeper passes covering Lodestar with the factory and swapper, Exile, Sandfall, and the keeper, scripts and site around them. Every finding was fixed, the last of them in [PR #3](https://github.com/monarchy-fi/monarchy/pull/3).
- **October 18, 2026:** a fourth pass over the lock-forever activation, the 7-day upgrade path and token-side rewards to lockers. It found no Critical or High issues. The fixes are in [PR #15](https://github.com/monarchy-fi/monarchy/pull/15), and the contract fixes reach testnet with the next core redeploy:
  - `distribute()` brings Exile up to date first, so it can't run out of gas after a long keeper outage.
  - Exile's `claimRewardTokenTo` pays reward-token rewards even if the stake token is paused.
  - The factory owner is set at deployment and changes hands in two steps.
  - The site says when a forever lock can still move.

  Two Medium findings concern the upgrade path itself and are handled by design. On a live chain the factory owner is a multisig separate from every steward, planned as a 2-of-2 with one key held by the Ascend team. A newer Lodestar must also keep paying the old Exile pool and Team Treasury stream, so an upgrade doesn't leave lockers earning nothing until their locks end.

## Design guarantees
