# Demo script (about 95 seconds)

Set up before recording: MONARCH launched on Ascend (Ascend's site or `npm run launch:testnet`), Monarchy deployed (`npm run deploy:testnet`). Wallet A is the dev and steward, wallet B a holder, wallet C the treasury recipient. Tabs open: the Monarchy site and the Elysium explorer. As a backup, the same flow runs locally with `npm run demo:local`.

| Time | Screen | Action (contract call) |
|---|---|---|
| 0–8 s | Title card, crown | "Monarchy: Lodestar, Exile, Sandfall. Ascend to Monarchy." Explorer shows the MONARCH launch on AscendLaunchpad. |
| 8–22 s | Lodestar page, wallet A | Token is prefilled. The wizard shows the router address before it exists (`factory.predict`). Click **Hand over creator role** (`launchpad.transferCreator`), then **Activate Lodestar** (`factory.deploy`: accepts the role, creates the Exile pool and the Sandfall treasury stream, enrols the listing set-aside, locks the role for a year). The router dashboard appears: 40/40/20 split, "Holds the creator role", "Role locked until…", "Listing set-aside: Enrolled". |
| 22–38 s | Lodestar page | Wallet B buys and sells MONARCH (Ascend's site or `AscendSwapper`). Click **Distribute** (`Lodestar.distribute()`). In the explorer, one transaction shows the collect, the claim, the token burn to 0xdead, the buyback swap, Exile's `RewardAdded` and Sandfall's `ToppedUp`. Dashboard counters jump. |
| 38–62 s | Exile page, wallet B | Tier cards with taglines. Pick **Monarch** (1 month, 3x), approve and lock (`lockERC20`). The lock card shows "Not cancellable", the unlock date and the reward counter ticking every 100 ms. Optional: a second wallet locks as Peasant and ticks visibly slower. **Claim** (`claimRewards`). |
| 62–82 s | Sandfall page, wallet C | The Team Treasury rolling stream fills; **Claim** (`claim`). Switch to wallet A: create a contributor vest with a 1 day cliff over 30 days marked **Cancellable** (amber badge, `createFixed`), and show an existing **Not cancellable** vest with its cancel button locked. |
| 82–95 s | Lodestar page, wallet A | Steward controls: propose a new split; the "Pending split change" card shows "Executable in 2d 23h" (`proposeConfig`). Closing card: roadmap (other launchpads, kHYPE treasury, Ascend NFTs, a router checkbox on Ascend's launch form) and links. |

Talking points:

- No fees on any feature. MONARCH runs on its own product.
- The dev launches on Ascend's site and keeps the dev buy; only the creator fee stream moves to Lodestar.
- `distribute()` is permissionless and safe to spam: the buyback is priced from the stricter of Ascend's EMA and spot, capped at a small share of pool depth and at most every 30 minutes, so sandwiching it doesn't pay, and anything that can't go out yet waits in reserve.
- Exile rewards drip over 3 days and stop at unlock, so sniping a payout or chaining 1 day locks earns far less than a real Monarch lock.
- Our own buyback pays the 1% pool fee, half of which comes straight back to Lodestar on the next collect.
